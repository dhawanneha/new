              <p>
To create awareness about University Health Services (UHS) and make it easier to access health services at UHS for all students at the University of Michigan</p>
              <h3 class="pad">Motivation</h3>
              <p>
To create awareness and make it easier and convenient for students at the University of Michigan to seek healthcare. There is general confusion with the process of seeking healthcare in the US and we wanted to understand the problems students at University of Michigan face to seek healthcare.</p>


              <h3 class=pad> Overview</h3>
<p>Many of the students enrolled at the University of Michigan have homes on the other side of the globe and many come from other states across the United States. Away from home, falling sick could be a particularly stressful experience. Our project aims to make it easier for students to get healthcare while they are enrolled in school.</p></div>

<div><h3 class="pad" >Target Audience</h3>
<p>The target audience of our project are all enrolled students at the University of Michigan. Our secondary audiences are the staff and faculty at the University of Michigan who are also eligible to visit UHS to seek healthcare</p></div>

<div><h3 class="pad">Research Phase 1: Exploratory Phase</h3>
<p>In our first round of research, our focus was to find the problems that students at UM face while seeking healthcare. We conducted 4 user interviews and 3 stakeholder interviews in this phase. We also conducted 4 more short informal interviews with users to get more insight into the problems. We then created an affinity wall to analyze all the interview data.</p>

 <p>We also conducted a survey to validate if the problems we identified through our interviews actually are encountered by more students. </p></div>

<div><h3 class="pad">Key Research Questions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How do students learn about getting healthcare?</li>

<li>What are their biggest concerns and questions about healthcare?</li>

<li>What is their process to getting healthcare when they are at school?</li>

<li>How aware are they about their rights and resources available at their disposal?</li>
</ul> </div>

</div>


   
<div><h3 class="pad" >What Do Users Need?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>An easy way to look at all available slots and book appointments at UHS</li>
<li>Awareness of the benefits they have at UHS as enrolled students</li>
Students don’t know that UHS visits are free of cost and they don’t need an insurance for doctor visits at UHS.

<li>Learn about health insurance jargon without putting in too much effort</li>

<li>Ability to find insurance related information easily</li>

<li>Ability to find information about how much to pay for particular procedures, visits, tests, and prescriptions</li>

<li>Ability to find if certain clinics accept their insurance easily and quickly</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="pad" >What Do Stakeholders Need?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Proper channels to create awareness among students about UHS</li>

<li>Reduce the workload on UHS employees by allowing online booking and cancellations</li>

<li>Help students resolve more pressing student queries than just help them to schedule appointments</li>

<li>Have resources that explain jargon and other healthcare related information without jargon that students can find and understand easily</li>

<li>At the end of research phase 1, we had very scattered findings so, we needed to conduct more research to narrow our scope.</li>
</ul>
</div>



<div><h3 class="pad" >Research Phase 2: Problem Validation</h3>
<p>At the end of our problem exploration phase, we realized that there were many problems that students face in getting healthcare. Some of these were larger issues that related to how healthcare process in the US works including complexity of health insurance. These issues required longer period of time and expert advise.</p>

 <img class="img-fluid" src="img/uhs/rp2.png" alt="Research phase 2 process">

<h4 class="pad"> Why We Decided To Focus On UHS</h4>
<p> UHS is important for students because it is the first stop for getting health care for all enrolled students at the University of Michigan yet our stakeholder told us that many students were not aware of their benefits with UHS.</p>

<h4 class="pad"> Research Questions For Stakeholders</h4>

<ul> 
  <li>Why can’t students book all appointments online?</li>

<li>What are the issues for which students call UHS?</li>

<li>Why can’t students register on the portal on their own?</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="pad"> Research Questions For Students</h4>
<ul> 
  <li>Are students aware about UHS?</li>

<li>Would students prefer to schedule appointments online for UHS? If yes, why? If not, why not?</li>

<li>What is their preferred platform for scheduling appointments online?</li>

<li>Are students aware about if they can use UHS without having an insurance plan?</li>
</ul>

<h4 class=pad>Follow-Up Interview With The Stakeholder</h4>


<ul>
  <li>Students do not care about which doctor they see. They want quicker appointments.</li>

<li>The reasons for not allowing students to book all appointments online is use of legacy processes.<br> Students could only book an online appointment with the doctor they had seen before. However, if students call they are allowed to book appointment with any doctor.</li></ul>

<h4 class="pad">Survey</h4>
<p>We got 54 responses in 2 days. 61% of our survey respondents are Domestic students while 30% were international students.</p>
<ul>
<li>57% of survey respondents mentioned that they learned about UHS at orientation.  </li>

<li> 38% respondents thought that they needed some insurance plan to get access to UHS</li>


<li>62% respondents said that they currently call to book appointments.</li>

<li>80% of respondents said that if they could book appointments online they would not want to call UHS.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="pad">Literature Review</h4>

<ul> <li>Younger and more tech savvy participants are more inclined to using website portals for viewing their health reports and scheduling appointments online. </li>

<li>One of the major reason cited in the study was that patients would prefer the online platform to current busy phone lines.</li>

<li>Online scheduling reduces the number of no-shows as patients can cancel appointments on the web. </li>

<li>Ability to book appointments in real time gives patients more satisfaction by reducing wait time and making the process transparent overall. </li>

<li>The main reasons why healthcare still is slow to respond with internet solutions are related to using legacy systems and workflows. <br> This just make the whole process go the more old school way. Other concerns such as patients abusing the system also have been an impediment to using technology. </li> </ul>

<h4 class="pad">Online Reviews</h4>
<p>We read reviews of UHS online on Yelp (23 reviews) and Google reviews (47 reviews). The average rating of UHS on Yelp was 2.3 and on Google 2.8 on a 5 point scale. Many users mentioned that scheduling appointments is a pain through calls and there should be a better solution in place. </p>

<h4 class="pad">Competitive Analysis </h4>
 
 <p> We did competitive analysis of UHS portal, Zocdoc, and Practo.</p>

          </div>


<h4 class="pad">What Stakeholders Need</h4>
<ul> <li>Reduce number of calls <br>

UHS receives 2500 calls a week and majority of them are to book appointments. </li>

<li>Ability to create awareness about UHS and what student benefits at UHS are</li> </ul>

<h4 class="pad"> What Students Need</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Students want a better system to schedule appointments online rather than the current system that involves calling UHS.<br>

</li>

<li>Students prefer booking appointments online because it is convenient, gives them ability to see all available slots or book outside working hours, not wanting to talk on the phone and saving time.</li>

<li>Not all students are aware that UHS consultations are free for them. 38% of our survey respondents wrongly believed that they need health insurance to visit UHS. </li></ul>

  <h3 class="pad">High Fidelity Solution</h3>
<p>We have used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, and PHP to implement the system. It uses PHP and MySQL queries to access the database. The front end of this web application is created using the bootstrap framework which makes it responsive and mobile friendly. This application uses the Twilio API to send confirmation messages on the user’s mobile number.</p></div>
  

<div>
  <h3 class="pad">Usability Test</h3>
<p>To evaluate our interface of our UHS portal, we conducted 5 usability tests. The overall feedback for booking appointments was positive but our reminder feature for urgent appointments needs some improvement.</p>

<p>We conducted 5 usability tests with graduate students at the University of Michigan. There were 3 females and 2 males. All tests were conducted in person and took around 20 minutes on average. We had a pre-test and post-test questionnaire. All the users were asked to perform 2 tasks. The first task had 6 subtasks and the 2nd task had 4 subtasks.</p>

<div>
<p>All our 5 users mentioned that their preferred mode of booking appointments is online. Three of our users did not know that UHS has a portal to book appointments. All our 5 users had been to UHS at some point in time.</p>


<h4 class="pad">Things That Worked Well</h4>
<ul>
  <li>All users intuitively logged in using their university of Michigan password.  </li>

<li>Three users liked that insurance information was optional since they did not remember that information. </li>

<li>All users liked the booking page and found it easy to interact with.</li>

<li>Users liked the option to have an urgent appointment in case they needed to book those.</li>

<li>Users also liked that they could see all the slots in one place.</li></ul>

<h4 class="pad">Scope For Improvement</h4>
<h5 class="pad">Finding 1</h5>

<p>Users were confused about the copy on the Reminders page. Users initially did not understand the point of a reminder. Most users were not familiar urgent appointment use case and that is why they were not sure.</p>

<h5 class="pad">Recommendation</h5>
<p>We need to  improve the copy of the page so that users can understand why they are setting the reminder.</p>

<h5 class="pad">Finding 2</h5>
<p>Two users were also confused if the reminder is going to be useful or how they are going to get the reminder. Also, one user thought that even with reminder on the phone, it might not work for her since, she does not wake up that early.</p>

<h5 class="pad">Recommendation</h5>
<p>We brainstormed a few ideas after this feedback. We thought it might help if we could add it to their calendar and also help in setting an alarm rather than just send users the text message to book the appointment. Although, users prefer the auto-booking the appointment the next day but the stakeholders at UHS don’t want to allow it because it could be misused by people who do not require urgent slots but might book them.</p>
